# NAW Classification
The purpose of this project is to prepare for a deep learning engineer interview at GATA.
Tensorflow-based CNNs have been used to classify images composed of numbers and words.
For better visualization, the classification result is saved as an HTML file. With five different convolution blocks, 93 percent accuracy was achieved.
